    <h2>Adriel Nissan</h2>
    <p>This project was for three different website for the same parent company: Adriel Kia, Adriel Nissan and Adriel Toyota. Their old website where designed monthly with the different shopper ads and took a lot of time to translate from their paper ad to a website. They wanted a template to be able to update the promotions much faster and focus on the top 3 cars on each monthly offers. The most important aspect being to generate leads of future buyers.
       <br><br>
       In collaboration with the Executive Creative Director we were able to come with a design that would be easy to use and update in the future focusing on the cars and generating leads. After finding the best design to use on the three different brands I began to develop having in mind that this will be updated every month with an easy to find documentation. For this website I used HTML, CSS, Jquery and PHP.
       <br><br>
       The results were a very easy to update website that could be adapted to the different campaigns that were running each one of them. The leads were now more focused on the cars that were promoted.
       <br><br>
       This is one of my favorite projects because I have been a car enthusiast since I was a kid.
