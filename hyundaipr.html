      <h2>Hyundai Puerto Rico</h2>
      <p>Hyundai Puerto Rico as a car brand has been modernizing their vehicles designs and technology in order to attract new and older customers, they wanted their website to reflect this new era.
        <br/><br/>
        When I started working for websoft this project had already began development, it was about 40% completed and I was tasked with managing the site. 
It was a fun challenge; this was one of my first projects developed through Joomla and gave me a better understanding of its core functions. During the development I had to make sure the structure was easy to follow in order to update existing vehicles or create new upcoming ones. Their focus has been customers accesibility to their cars, promotions, and the tools available to help everyone with their purchase. Additionally, I had to work with their marketing team and agency to create a more efficient way to develop their promotional landing pages, designing templates which we both followed in order to efficiently upload or update them.
        <br/><br/>

        The site has evolved a lot during the year, at first it was just an informative page of the vehicles, their brand, and offers. Now it has multiple tools to help users achieve finding their right car using a calculator, build & price, order a test drive and more. All of these tools helped the company reach their customers better during the pandemic.

        <br/><br/>
        
        This has been the biggest site I have worked on, constantly evolving creating new ways to reach their customers digitally.
