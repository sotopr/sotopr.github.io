          <h2>Liceo de Arte y Tecnología</h2>
          <p>Liceo de Arte y Tecnología is a college institution located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Liceo has been offering multiple programs in different disciplines for more than 50 years. The look of their website was very outdated and they were going to launch a new marketing campaign on digital and print. They wanted to update the website to match the new marketing campaign strategy and brand guidelines focusing on generating new leads to sign up for the different courses.
             <br><br>
             I was tasked with the redesign and development of their new website. The process began by studying the new marketing campaign guidelines and sketching concepts for different style of wireframes. With the selected design by the president of HIT and Liceo I began the development of the website from scratch using HTML, CSS and Jquery while also implementing the SEO for each individual page.
             <br><br>
             The results were as expected with the new marketing campaign traffic to the website was increased and with the more focused click to action design it was generating more leads.
             <br><br>
             This was my very first professional web based project and it was full of challenges that I was able to fullfil and exceeded my own expectations. This project was completed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.jenniecortes.com/" target="_blank">Jennie Cortés</a> for <img src="images/logo-hit.png" alt="" /> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hitinteractive" target="_blank">HIT Interactive Marketing Group</a>.
